  <h2>Operating System에 대해 공부해보자</h2>
  <p><a href="https://jhnyang.tistory.com/16" target="_blank" title="운영체제에 대하여
    ">Operating systems</a> are an essential part of any computer system. Similarly,
  a course on operating systems is an essential part of any computer-science
  education. This field is undergoing rapid change, as computers are now
  prevalent in virtually every application, from games for children through the
  most sophisticated planning tools for governments and multinational firms.
  Yet the fundamental concepts remain fairly clear, and it is on these that we base
  this book.</p><p style="margin-top:50px;">We wrote this book as a text for an introductory course in operating systems
  at the junior or senior undergraduate level or at the first-year graduate level.
  We hope that practitioners will also find it useful. It provides a clear description
  of the concepts that underlie operating systems. As prerequisites, we assume
  that the reader is familiar with basic data struchues, computer organization,
  and a high-level language, such as C or Java. The hardware topics required
  for an understanding of operating systems are included in Chapter 1. For code
  examples, we use predominantly C, with some Java, but the reader can still
  understand the algorithms without a thorough knowledge of these languages.</p>
